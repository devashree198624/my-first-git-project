✅ Full Summary: Git & GitHub Setup (Without hello.py)
📁 Working Folder:
bash
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\Devashree_Anantharaj\OneDrive - Dell Technologies\Intern Project\GitHubPrac\my-first-git-project
🔹 Step 1: Create a Local Git Repository
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git init
🧠 Function:
Initializes an empty Git repository in your project folder.

Creates a hidden .git/ directory that tracks your files and versions.

🔹 Step 2: Create Your First File
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "# My First Git Project" > README.md
🧠 Function:
Creates a README.md file with one line of text.

Markdown file commonly used to describe the project.

🔹 Step 3: Stage the File
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add README.md
🧠 Function:
Adds the file to the staging area.

Tells Git that you want to include this file in the next commit.

🔹 Step 4: Commit the File
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Initial commit"
🧠 Function:
Saves the current state of the staged file to the Git repository.

The -m flag lets you write a short commit message explaining the change.

🔹 Step 5: Rename the Default Branch to main
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git branch -M main
🧠 Function:
Renames the current branch to main.

The -M flag forces the rename even if the branch already exists.

🔹 Step 6: Create a GitHub Repository
🧠 Action (manual):
Go to: https://github.com/new

Name it: my-first-git-project

Uncheck: “Initialize with README”

Click Create Repository

GitHub gives you instructions to push an existing repo — you used those next.

🔹 Step 7: Connect Local to Remote
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add origin https://github.com/devashree198624/my-first-git-project.git
🧠 Function:
Connects your local repository to the GitHub remote repository.

origin is just a name (alias) for that remote URL.

🔹 Step 8: Push Your Local Code to GitHub
✅ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main
🧠 Function:
Pushes the local main branch to GitHub’s main branch.

-u sets origin/main as the default upstream branch, so future pushes/pulls are easier:

Later you can just use git push or git pull without specifying branch names.

✅ Final Result:
You now have:

A local Git repository with your README.md

A GitHub repository named my-first-git-project

Code pushed and published to:
